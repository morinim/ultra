We sincerely appreciate everyone who shows interest and contributes to the project. No contribution is too small and all contributions are valued.

Whether you're a developer, a tester, or simply a user providing feedback, you can help shape ULTRA's future.

## Contributing

There are several ways you can help the development:

#### Improve the documentation

Did you spot a typo? Do you think something could be clarified? Please suggest a documentation patch! *Your help in this area is greatly appreciated since English is not our mother tongue*.

#### Blog about Ultra

Share your experience with ULTRA by writing blog posts or tutorials. Your content helps more users discover the project and learn how to use it effectively.

#### Report bugs and request features in the issue tracker

When reporting a bug or requesting a new feature, keep these guidelines in mind:

1. check if the issue or request already exists by searching the issue tracker;
2. while we aim to respond promptly, ULTRA is provided as-is, meaning support depends on the availability of contributors;
3. avoid reopening issues marked *wontfix*. These decisions reflect careful deliberation by the core team;
4. write detailed, reproducible bug reports with as much information as possible, including:
    - clear problem descriptions
    - step-by-step instructions to replicate the issue
    - minimal, concise test cases or code snippets demonstrating the problem
5. for **security issues**,  label them with the *[security][security_label]* label. While we take security seriously, addressing vulnerabilities depends on their complexity and severity. We currently follow a [full disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_(computer_security)) policy.

#### Triage tickets

Help improve issue management by reviewing tickets submitted by others. If a ticket is valid and you can reproduce the bug, confirm it and accept the ticket. You might also:

- ensure it is categorised under the correct component;
- add test cases that validate the reported issue.

#### Submit patches for new and/or fixed behavior
(requires to sign a [CLA][cla])

For newcomers, explore the beginner-friendly tickets to get started.

Before starting a major task, ensure the idea has community support. Discuss bugs or features in the issue tracker to avoid duplicating efforts.

Refer to the [development cycle][development_cycle] for best practices in submitting patches.

#### Write unit tests

Unit tests ensure ULTRA's reliability and stability. Here's how you can contribute:

- review the existing test suite to understand the framework and patterns used;
- focus on writing clear, concise tests that cover key features and edge cases;
- run all tests locally to confirm they pass before submitting your patch;
- refer to [development guidelines][development_cycle] for detailed testing instructions.

By contributing tests, you directly improve ULTRA's code quality and user experience.
