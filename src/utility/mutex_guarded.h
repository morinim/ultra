/// A bundled mutex and `T`.
///
/// You cannot access `T` directly. The only way weâ€™ll let you access `T` is by
/// calling `read` / `write` and passing it a callback that takes a `T &`
/// parameter.
///
/// When called, `read` / `write` locks the mutex, then invokes the callback
/// and finally unlocks the mutex again before returning.
///
/// This solves the issue of someone forgetting to lock the mutex before
/// accessing the field.
/// Since the mutex and field have been combined into a single variable, you no
/// longer have to be aware of the relationship between the two: it's been
/// encoded into the type system!
