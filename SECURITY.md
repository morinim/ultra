# Security Policy

## Supported versions

**We only provide security patches for the latest stable version**. We recommend all users upgrade immediately when a new release is available.

Vulnerability priority is determined by the [CVSS v4.0 Rating][CVSS]:

| CVSS    | Patch priority | Target resolution |
| ---     | ---            | ---               |
| **9.0 - 10.0 (Critical)** | Immediate | As soon as technically possible |
| **4.0 - 8.9 (Medium/High)** | High | Targeted for the next point release |
| **0.1 - 3.9 (Low)** | Standard | Best effort; usually included in the next scheduled release |


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead write at **info~~REMOVE_ME~~@ultraevolution.org**.

### Our Process

1. **Acknowledgement**. You will receive a response within 3 business days.
2. **Investigation**. We will work with you to understand the scope and impact.
3. **Fix & Disclosure**. Once a fix is ready, we will coordinate a release and credit you for the discovery (if desired).

We ask that you practice responsible disclosure and refrain from sharing details publicly until a patch has been released.
